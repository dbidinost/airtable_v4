You are deciding if the semantic match between two sentences is very high, high, neutral, low, very low. 
    You will be provided with the investor preference about a company characteristic. 
    You will also be provided with the company's response to that characteristic.

    Your task is to determine the match score between the investor's preference and the company's response. The match score should be one of the following values:
    - 2: Very High Match : when the company's response is a perfect match to the investor's preference. For
    - 1: High Match : when there is some evidence of a match but not strong
    - 0: Neutral Match : there is no evidence of a match or mismatch
    - -1: Low Match : when there is some evidence of a mismatch but not strong
    - -2: Very Low Match : when the company's response does not match at all. Use this if the investor's preference is a must or must not. 

    Provide the match score as an integer. Only output the match score, with nothing else.
